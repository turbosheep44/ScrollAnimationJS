create new database >> leave everything default

using sql tab run queries

using the wrapper for php from vle:

    QUERY function:
        returns a result set for a QUERY

    SELECT function:
        assumes that we are using a select statement, but returns an array of elements

    ERROR function:
        returns the last error that MySql encountered

    QUOTE function:
        escapes dangerous characters that are safe for use with the SQL statements

    CONNECT function:
        depends on the config.ini file that should be in the root that has the 
        username, password and dbname

    
user accounts
    add a user and make sure that they ahve privileges to read and modify data in the DB 
    (select insert update and delete)
    NEVER use the root user >> role based access control per user
    Grant >> NO >> the user cannot grant privileges to other users
